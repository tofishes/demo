Permalink Redirect ensures that pages and entries are always accessed via the permalink. Otherwise, a 301 redirect will be issued.

== Description ==

Permalink Redirect provides a solution where a page on a WordPress site can be accessed via multiple URLs. It ensures each post can only be accessed by one true URL defined by the permalink structure, and other URLs used to access that page will get a 301 redirect to that true permalink.

It is useful for SEO purposes to eliminate duplicated contents.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ylsy_permalink_redirect.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. There is no step 3!
